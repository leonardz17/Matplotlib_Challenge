## Introduction
Analyze a hypothetical pharmaceutical company and their drugs for treatment of tumors. Using methodologies in Pandas and Matplotlib, I was able to create visualizations from dataframes, to charts, such as bar, scatter and box plots. With these I was able to analyze the data and come to some conclusions about the drugs and the effects.
